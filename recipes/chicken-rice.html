        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>While your chicken is cooking, it helps to prepare the ingredients for your chili sauce and rice. Both of these are usually assembled <br> after the chicken is done because they require the chicken broth, but you can get started washing and soaking the rice, chopping <br> the garlic and ginger. In this recipe, all of the poaching broth is reserved -- some is used in the rice, a small amount is used in the <br> chili sauce, and the remainder is saved to be heated and served as a simple soup to accompany the chicken.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For Chicken</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken 3.5 lbs, 1.8kg, preferably organic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup kosher salt for exfoliating (the salt is for cleaning the chicken, this is not consumed)</li>
            <li>4 inch section of fresh ginger peeled and cut into 1/4'' slices</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 stalks green onion cut into 1" sections (both green and white parts)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Cook the Chicken</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil a large pot of water. In the meantime, clean the chicken by exfoliating with kosher or coarse salt. Rinse chicken well,<br> inside and outside.</li>
            <li>PRE-BOIL CHICKEN: When water is at a hard boil, add the chicken. Return to hard boil, let scum come to the surface.<br> Boil for 5 minutes. Discard all the water, including the scum.</li>
            <li>Refill pot with clean water to cover the chicken by 1-inch, and add in the garlic, green onion and ginger. Bring the pot to<br> a boil over high heat, then immediately turn the heat to low to keep a simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes more (less if <br>you're using a smaller chicken). Check for doneness by sticking a chopstick into the flesh under the leg and see if the <br>juices run clear or insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh not touching bone. It should read 160F. The <br>chicken will continue to cook to 165F during rest.</li>
            <li>When the chicken is cooked through, turn off the heat and remove the pot from the burner. Immediately lift and transfer <br>the chicken into a bath of ice water to cool. The quick cooling will stop the cooking process, keeping the meat soft and <br>tender, and giving the skin a lovely firm texture. After cooling, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub the sesame<br> oil all over the chicken. This will help prevent the chicken from drying out.</li>
        </ol>
