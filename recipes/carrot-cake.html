        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Despite the name, this Singaporean street food favourite doesnâ€™t contain any carrot at all. Instead, white radish makes the base of this comforting savoury cake which is crisp on the outside while soft and chewy in the centre.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>60ml (1/4 cup) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp preserved chopped radish (chye poh), washed and rinsed</li>
            <li>chilli paste, to taste (optional)</li>
            <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 tbsp caramel black sauce (karamel masakan)</li>
            <li>pinch freshly ground white pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Radish cake</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>500g white radish, peeled</li>
            <li>200g rice flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 salt</li>
            <li>vegetable stock</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the radish cake, grate the radish and place into a large bamboo steamer basket. Cover and steam over low heat for <br>30 minutes or until translucent. Remove and set aside to cool. </li>
            <li>Combine the rice flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add the stock and mix well, then add the cooled radish. Pour the <br>mixture into baking dish about 15 cm x 20 cm and steam over medium heat for 30 minutes or until a skewer withdraws <br>clean. Stand to cool, then refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Cut half the radish cake into bite-sized cubes. The remaining radish cake will keep refrigerated for up to 1 week.</li>
            <li>Heat a large non-stick frying pan over high heat, then add 2 tbsp oil. When the oil is hot, add the radish cubes and fry until <br>golden and slightly crisp on all sides. Move the radish cake to the outside of the pan, then add the remaining oil to the <br>centre of the pan. Add the garlic and preserved radish and stir for 30 seconds or until fragrant.  Add the chilli paste if using. </li>
            <li>Stir together and mash the radish cube slightly to encourage the rough edges to be crispy. Reduce the heat to medium, add the <br>beaten eggs and allow to lightly set. Add the caramel black sauce and gently stir through. Gently flip the radish cake over and <br>cook until golden on both sides. Season with white pepper. Serve scattered with spring onions, sliced chillies and fried <br>shallots.</li>
        </ol>
