        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kaya is a very sweet coconut jam, considered a staple throughout Singapore and parts of Malaysia. It is best served on unseeded whole <br>meal toast with a soft boiled egg, and washed down with strong black coffee. (Adam Liaw)</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Kaya</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>10 eggs</li>
            <li>1kg caster sugar, plus 50g extra</li>
            <li>5 fresh pandan leaves, tied in a knot</li>
            <li>550ml coconut cream</li>
            <li>20g unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Half-cooked eggs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 free-range eggs (at room temperature)</li>
            <li>dash of soy sauce</li>
            <li>pinch of ground white pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Toast</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices whole meal bread</li>
            <li>4 unsalted butter (thick slices)</li>
            <li>pinch of sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4></h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>To make the kaya</strong>, combine the eggs and 1 kg sugar in a tall, slender saucepan and whisk in one direction until smooth and runny.</li>
            <li><strong>To make the half-cooked eggs</strong>, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil and remove from the heat. Add 125 ml (Â½ cup) of cold<br> water to the pan, then add the eggs. Cover the pan and allow to stand for 6 minutes. Crack the eggs into two bowls and add a dash<br> of soy sauce and white pepper to each.</li>
            <li><strong>To make the toast</strong>, grill the bread until well-toasted. Cut off the crusts and cover with slices of butter. Spread generously with 1-2<br> tablespoons kaya, then cut in half.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Note</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh pandan leaves give the jam a slightly toasted, nutty flavour. Fresh leaves are readily available from Asian greengrocers.</li>
            <li>This recipe makes about 1 litre of kaya which will keep refrigerated in sterilized jars for 1-2 weeks.</li>
        </ul>
